# Changelog

All notable changes to Encore are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), and versions are
tagged `vX.Y.Z` (PBK Chapter 17).

This file is updated by every pull request, under **Unreleased**. The release
process moves that section into a dated version heading.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Repository bootstrap (PBK): the fixed directory layout, `pyproject.toml` as
  the single project configuration, `uv`-managed dependencies with a lockfile,
  and an editable development install.
- Quality tooling: Ruff (lint + format), MyPy in strict mode, pytest with
  category markers, Coverage.py and pre-commit hooks covering formatting,
  linting, import order, whitespace, EOF, YAML, TOML, Markdown and secret
  detection.
- CI/CD: `validate.yml`, `test.yml`, `docs.yml`, `security.yml` (CodeQL, OSV
  audit, dependency review, secret scan) and `release.yml` for tagged releases.
- GitHub configuration: CODEOWNERS, Dependabot, branch protection definition,
  the label taxonomy from PBK Chapter 10, seven issue forms and a pull request
  template.
- Documentation scaffolding: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY,
  CHANGELOG, LICENSE, the documentation map, and outlines for the user guide,
  administrator guide, developer handbook, API reference, troubleshooting guide
  and release process.
- Initial ADRs 001–008, covering builder/server separation, HTMX over a SPA,
  SQLite storage, the internal Event Bus, mpv playback, the immutable library
  database, the anonymous guest model and the appliance-first philosophy.
- Test infrastructure: shared fixtures, temporary SQLite helpers, a mock mpv
  JSON-IPC double, Party Simulation load profiles with a loader, performance
  target registry, and synthetic media generator hooks (placeholders).
- Architecture guardrail tests that enforce the SAPRS 11.10 rules in CI.
- AI development support materials in `ai/`: the standard prompt header, task
  templates, code-review prompt, feature and regression checklists and context
  bundles derived from the AIG.
- Developer scripts: `bootstrap.sh`, `lint.sh`, `format.sh`, `test.sh`,
  `check.sh`, `run-server.sh`, `run-builder.sh`, `sync-labels.sh`,
  `configure-branch-protection.sh`, `setup-github-repo.sh`.
